Viral Disease Vulnerability Analysis

Description

This project focuses on analyzing and identifying which types of patients are most vulnerable to viral diseases.
Using a hospital dataset, the project explores the relationship between pre-existing conditions (like heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, brain disease, and lung disease) and viral infections. The analysis also includes sorting patients by age groups, understanding viral spread patterns, and ranking hospitals based on their performance.

Core Focus of the Project

Main Goal:

To find which type of existing medical condition (heart, diabetes, kidney, brain, lung) is most linked to viral infections.

Patient Analysis:

Identify the proportion of viral infections among heart, diabetes, kidney, brain, and lung disease patients.
Compare and visualize which group is at higher risk of being affected.

Supporting Analyses:

Visualize the number of patients affected by each disease.
Analyze the age distribution of virally infected patients.
Find out the proportion of population affected by viral diseases.
Sort patients by age and viral infection status.
List top hospitals based on hospital ratings.

Technologies Used

Python
Pandas (data processing)
Matplotlib and Seaborn (visualization)
NumPy (numerical operations)
